# BTAuthOrchestrator

BTAuthOrchestrator is the org's unified authentication service for
internally-built tools. Today each internal tool rolls its own local
login — that doesn't scale past one app and makes deprovisioning a leaver
error-prone. BTAuthOrchestrator fixes that by being the one thing that
authenticates users (via Microsoft Entra ID / O365, over standard OIDC) and
mints a signed session token every internal tool can verify on its own,
without a hard runtime dependency on this service being up.

It is not a general-purpose IdP product and does not support external or
non-employee identities — see `NOTES.md` for the full design rationale.

## Status

Milestone 1-2 (Entra app registration through the offline-verification
proof) is implemented and accepted. The one open item is TASK-003d: TLS
termination in front of the service, blocked on Cloudflare DNS
credentials. See `tasks/completed/` for what's shipped and
`tasks/approved/` for what's next.

## Setup

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in the values below
npm run build
npm run seed            # one-time: stores CLIENT_SECRET and the initial signing key
npm start
```

`.env` requires eight variables (see `.env.example`): `PORT`,
`PGLITE_DATA_DIR`, `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `COOKIE_SECURE`, `TENANT_ID`,
`CLIENT_ID`, `SERVICE_ISSUER`, and `EMERGENCY_ROTATION_TOKEN`. The service
fails closed at startup if any is missing or invalid — there is no silent
default.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Build, then start. |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and compile to `dist/`. |
| `npm run seed` | Build, then run the one-time bootstrap (stores `CLIENT_SECRET`, generates the initial signing key). Safe to re-run; refuses if already seeded. |
| `npm start` | Run the compiled service. |
| `npm run verify-offline` | Build, then run a standalone, re-runnable proof that a minted token verifies completely offline and that a rotated-out key's tokens correctly fail. |

## Endpoints

To enable public local account creation, set
`ALLOW_NEW_LOCAL_LOGIN_CREATION=True` in `.env`, rebuild, and restart the
service. Open `/auth/local-register` (for example,
`http://localhost:3210/auth/local-register`), also linked from local sign-in.
The form uses `POST /admin/users`. Missing or non-true values block creation
on the server. Listing, editing, and deleting users still require the admin token.
The registration page publicly shows local usernames and Active/Disabled status,
including when creation is disabled. The full admin list API remains protected.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | Liveness check. |
| `GET /auth/login` | Starts the OIDC flow: redirects to Entra with PKCE/state/nonce. |
| `GET /auth/callback` | Entra's registered redirect URI; on success, sets the `bt_session` cookie. |
| `GET /.well-known/jwks.json` | Public signing keys (current + retired), for any consuming app to verify tokens independently. |
| `POST /admin/emergency-rotate-keys` | Break-glass "kill switch": immediately rotates the signing key and invalidates every outstanding session, org-wide. Bearer-token authenticated, separate from any user session. |
