# Development Guide

## Technology stack

- Node.js with TypeScript.
- Node.js's built-in HTTP server and environment-file support.
- PGlite (`@electric-sql/pglite`) for the embedded PostgreSQL-compatible data
  store.
- `jose` for RS256 JWT signing and public-key/JWK conversion.

## Repository layout

- `src/`: service source code, including bootstrap configuration and the HTTP
  entry point. `src/password.ts` holds scrypt password hashing/verification
  and `src/localUsers.ts`/`src/ipThrottle.ts` hold the local-login user store
  and per-source-IP throttle (CONTRACT-005).
- `scripts/seed.js`: stable bootstrap entry point that loads the compiled seed
  implementation from `dist/seed.js`.
- `dist/`: compiled JavaScript output created by the build (not committed).
- `docs/`: project documentation, contracts, decisions, and workflow guidance.
- `tasks/`: lifecycle-managed task records.

## Setup and commands

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace its example values as appropriate.
`PORT`, `PGLITE_DATA_DIR`, `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `COOKIE_SECURE`,
`SERVICE_ISSUER`, `EMERGENCY_ROTATION_TOKEN`, `LOCAL_LOGIN`, and
`LOCAL_USER_ADMIN_TOKEN` are always required and must be non-empty; `PORT`
must be an integer from 1 through 65535. `TENANT_ID` and `CLIENT_ID` are
required only when `LOCAL_LOGIN=false` (see "Local username/password login"
below); four further brute-force-protection variables are optional with
sane defaults (same section).

`SERVICE_ISSUER` sets the session-token `iss` claim. Production must use
`https://orca.biztechro.com`; non-production deployments may use their own
canonical issuer value.

`EMERGENCY_ROTATION_TOKEN` is the dedicated bearer credential for
`POST /admin/emergency-rotate-keys` (CONTRACT-003). It must be at least 32
characters and is unrelated to any Entra identity, `bt_session` cookie, or
`CLIENT_SECRET`; generate it with, e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`. The service
fails closed at startup if it is missing or shorter than 32 characters, the
same posture as `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

`LOCAL_USER_ADMIN_TOKEN` is the dedicated bearer credential for the local-user
admin API (`/admin/users*`, CONTRACT-005 §4, TASK-016). Same format/length
rule as `EMERGENCY_ROTATION_TOKEN` (at least 32 characters, fails closed at
startup otherwise) and deliberately a separate value from it on
least-privilege grounds.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run seed
npm start
npm run verify-offline
```

`npm run dev` builds/type-checks and starts the service. `npm run build` compiles
and type-checks it into `dist/`, and `npm start` runs the compiled service.
The health check is available at `GET /health`. Public signing keys are
available at `GET /.well-known/jwks.json`; this response includes current and
retired keys, excludes revoked keys, and uses `Cache-Control: no-store`.

The OIDC login flow (CONTRACT-001) is implemented at `GET /auth/login`
(redirects to Entra with a freshly generated, single-use `state`/`nonce`/PKCE
`code_verifier`, held in an in-memory, 10-minute-TTL handshake store) and
`GET /auth/callback` (Entra's registered redirect URI; exchanges the
authorization code, validates the ID token against Entra's own cached
discovery document and JWKS, and on success mints and sets the `bt_session`
cookie via `src/tokens.ts`). Entra's discovery document is fetched lazily on
first use and cached in memory (a transient refetch failure falls back to the
last-known-good document rather than failing a login); Entra's JWKS is cached
by `jose`'s own remote-JWKS-set logic. `CLIENT_SECRET` is read via
`SecretsStore.getSecret("CLIENT_SECRET")` at each callback, never from `.env`.
Failure responses follow CONTRACT-001's fixed status-code tiers (502 for an
unreachable Entra, 400 for an invalid/expired handshake or a rejected/invalid
token exchange, 500 for a missing identity claim or other unexpected error)
and are always plain HTML with a generic, non-technical message.

### Local username/password login (CONTRACT-005)

`LOCAL_LOGIN` is a strict, whole-service mode switch (`"true"`/`"false"`,
case-insensitive, no implicit default): exactly one of the two login paths
is ever live. `LOCAL_LOGIN=true` makes `POST /auth/local-login` live and
makes `GET /auth/login`/`GET /auth/callback` fall through to the same
generic `404` used by any unmatched route (no discovery fetch, no handshake
entry, no token exchange executes). `LOCAL_LOGIN=false` is the reverse:
`POST /auth/local-login` is the one that 404s, and Entra's routes behave
exactly as CONTRACT-001 already specifies. `GET /.well-known/jwks.json`,
`POST /admin/emergency-rotate-keys`, and the admin CRUD API (`/admin/users*`,
see below) are all unaffected by this flag in either state. `GET
/auth/local-login` (a minimal HTML login form, CONTRACT-005 §11, TASK-018) is
gated identically to the JSON endpoint: live only when `LOCAL_LOGIN=true`,
otherwise the same generic `404` as any unmatched route.

When `LOCAL_LOGIN=true`, `TENANT_ID`/`CLIENT_ID` are not required and may be
absent from `.env` entirely; when present anyway they are simply unused.
When `LOCAL_LOGIN=false`, `TENANT_ID`/`CLIENT_ID` are required exactly as
before.

`POST /auth/local-login` accepts `{"username": string, "password": string}`
and authenticates against the `local_users` table, populated either by
`scripts/seed.js`'s first-user bootstrap step (below) or by the admin API's
`POST /admin/users` (see "Local user admin API" below). Passwords are hashed
with
Node's built-in `crypto.scrypt` (`N=131072`, `r=8`, `p=1`, 64-byte derived
key, a fresh 16-byte salt per password, `maxmem` explicitly set to 256 MiB
on every call — the default 32 MiB `maxmem` is too small for these
parameters and throws `ERR_CRYPTO_INVALID_SCRYPT_PARAMS` otherwise).
Verification always performs a same-cost scrypt derivation — against a
fixed dummy salt/password when the username doesn't match any row — before
deciding the outcome, so response timing cannot distinguish an unknown
username from a known username with the wrong password. The response is a
two-tier scheme: unknown username and wrong password both produce an
identical `401 {"error":"Invalid username or password."}`; a disabled
account produces its own `403`; a locked account produces its own `423`
naming the exact unlock time. On success, the response is
`200 {"status":"signed_in","username":"<username>"}` plus a `Set-Cookie`
header — the `bt_session` cookie is minted via the same `mintSessionToken`
(`src/tokens.ts`) and cookie-construction logic CONTRACT-001's callback uses,
not a reimplementation.

`GET /auth/local-login` (CONTRACT-005 §11, TASK-018) serves a minimal,
unstyled, self-contained HTML page (a username/password form) at the same
gating as the JSON endpoint above. The page contains no credential
verification of its own: its inline `<script>` calls `POST
/auth/local-login` via `fetch()` on submit and only renders that response —
on success it replaces the form with a plain "You're signed in." message on
the same page (no redirect); on failure it displays the JSON response's
`error` string verbatim (no reinterpretation), so disabled/locked/merged
unknown-username-or-bad-password messages appear exactly as `POST
/auth/local-login` produced them. No CSS, branding, or responsive design is
included, per CONTRACT-005 §11.

Brute-force protection has two layers, both configurable via optional
`.env` variables (each validated as a positive integer if present; silently
defaulted if absent — the one exception in this project to the
required-with-no-implicit-default posture):
`LOCAL_LOGIN_MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS` (default `10`) consecutive wrong-password
attempts locks a `local_users` account for `LOCAL_LOGIN_LOCKOUT_MINUTES`
(default `15`) minutes (`locked_until`); attempts made while already locked
do not extend the lockout, and a correct password after it passes clears
both `failed_login_attempts` and `locked_until`. Separately,
`LOCAL_LOGIN_IP_THROTTLE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default `20`) failed attempts from
one source IP (across any usernames) within a rolling
`LOCAL_LOGIN_IP_THROTTLE_WINDOW_MINUTES` (default `5`) minute window produce
`429` on further attempts from that IP until the window rolls forward; this
in-memory counter (`src/ipThrottle.ts`) resets on process restart, the same
accepted tradeoff as the OIDC handshake store. Every `/auth/local-login`
attempt (success or failure) writes one row to `local_login_audit`,
best-effort — a malformed request (missing/invalid body) is rejected `400`
before any lookup, hashing, or audit write occurs.

#### Local user admin API (CONTRACT-005 §4, TASK-016)

`POST /admin/users`, `GET /admin/users`, `GET /admin/users/:id`,
`PATCH /admin/users/:id`, and `DELETE /admin/users/:id` create, list, fetch,
update, and hard-delete `local_users` rows. Every one of these endpoints is
reachable **regardless of `LOCAL_LOGIN`'s value** — this surface is not
gated by that switch, so an operator can provision/curate local user records
whether or not local-login mode is currently active. Each request must carry
`Authorization: Bearer <LOCAL_USER_ADMIN_TOKEN>`, checked with
`crypto.timingSafeEqual` (never `===`), the same constant-time-comparison
helper `POST /admin/emergency-rotate-keys` uses; a missing, malformed, or
incorrect header always returns a generic `401 {"error":"Unauthorized"}` that
never distinguishes which check failed, and a valid `bt_session` cookie alone
never substitutes for this token. All admin responses include
`Cache-Control: no-store`.

`POST /admin/users` accepts `{"username": string, "email": string,
"password": string, "actedBy"?: string}` and returns `201` with the created
user's public fields (`id`, `username`, `email`, `isActive`, `createdAt`,
`updatedAt` — never a password hash or hashing parameter). `username` is
normalized to lowercase and validated as 3-64 characters of lowercase
letters, digits, `.`, `-`, or `_`; `password` must be at least 12 characters
(hashed via the same `src/password.ts` `hashPassword` the local-login path
verifies against); a duplicate `username` or `email` returns `409` naming
which field collided. `GET /admin/users` returns `200 {"users": [...]}` (no
pagination); `GET /admin/users/:id` returns the same shape for one user or
`404 {"error":"No such user."}`. `PATCH /admin/users/:id` updates `email`,
`password`, and/or `isActive` (at least one required); a password change
resets `failed_login_attempts`/`locked_until`. **Username is not renamable
via `PATCH`** — a `username` field in the request body is rejected `400`;
delete and recreate the user instead. An `email` collision returns `409`; an
unknown `id` returns `404`. `DELETE /admin/users/:id` hard-deletes the row
and returns `200 {"status":"deleted","id":string,"username":string}`, or
`404` if the id doesn't exist; existing `local_login_audit`/
`local_user_admin_audit` rows referencing that user are never deleted.
Because the caller already holds `LOCAL_USER_ADMIN_TOKEN`, error messages on
this surface are specific (e.g. naming which field is invalid or which value
conflicted) — unlike the enumeration-resistant, merged responses on the
public `/auth/local-login` surface.

Every `create`/`update`/`delete` action (success or failure) and every
admin-API authentication failure writes exactly one row to
`local_user_admin_audit` (`action`, `target_user_id`, `target_username`,
`changed_fields`, `result`, `failure_reason`, `actor_label`, `source_ip`),
best-effort — a database failure never blocks the caller's response, falling
back to a server-side log-line backstop instead. A successful read (`GET
/admin/users`, `GET /admin/users/:id`) is not itself audited (only an
authentication failure on those endpoints is), since CONTRACT-005 §6 and the
audit table's `action` values (`create`/`update`/`delete`/`auth_failure`)
scope the audit trail to write actions and auth failures, not reads.
`actedBy`, when supplied on `POST`/`PATCH`, is stored verbatim as
`actor_label`/`created_by` — an unverified, operator-self-asserted label,
the same caveat CONTRACT-003 already accepts for `triggeredBy`.

After configuring `.env` and building, bootstrap a fresh database with the
normative command `node scripts/seed.js`. The launcher starts the compiled
implementation with Node's `--env-file=.env` support. It prompts for
`CLIENT_SECRET` without echoing input and generates the initial RS256 signing
key. For non-interactive setup, use
`node scripts/seed.js --client-secret-file=<path>`; the input
file is deleted immediately after it is read and before the database is opened.
Never pass the secret itself on the command line. `npm run seed` is a convenience
alias that builds first and then runs the same entry point.

Alongside `CLIENT_SECRET`/the signing key, `scripts/seed.js` also provisions
the first `local_users` row (CONTRACT-005 §5, TASK-017), extending the same
idempotent "what needs seeding" check with one more piece: on every
invocation it also checks whether any row exists in `local_users`. If one or
more rows already exist, this piece is reported as already seeded
(`local_users already seeded; skipping.`) and no row is added, changed, or
removed. If zero rows exist, it prompts for a username, an email, and a
password using the same class of input handling as `CLIENT_SECRET`: username
and email are prompted visibly (echoed) so an operator can see and correct
typos, and the password prompt is hidden (not echoed), matching
`CLIENT_SECRET`'s own hidden prompt. For non-interactive setup, use
`node scripts/seed.js --local-user-file=<path>`; the file must contain
exactly three lines, in order — username, then email, then password — with an
optional single trailing newline. Exactly like `--client-secret-file`, this
file is read once and deleted immediately afterward (before the database is
even opened), and if the delete fails the whole run aborts with nothing
written to PGlite and an instruction to delete the file manually, rather than
proceeding with a leftover plaintext file on disk. Username/email/password
are validated against the same format rules `POST /admin/users` applies
(username: normalized lowercase, 3-64 characters,
`[a-z0-9._-]`; password: at least 12 characters); an invalid file or
interactive value aborts the run with a clear error naming the problem
without revealing the invalid value itself. The password is hashed via the
same `src/password.ts` `hashPassword` function (and the same scrypt
parameters) the admin API and the local-login path use — not a separate or
simplified routine — and the resulting row is inserted with
`is_active = true`, zeroed lockout state (`failed_login_attempts = 0`,
`locked_until = NULL`), and `created_by = 'seed-script'`. This step runs
regardless of `LOCAL_LOGIN`'s value: pre-staging a local user is harmless in
a deployment currently running Entra-only, since `/auth/local-login` never
consults `local_users` while `LOCAL_LOGIN=false`. As with `CLIENT_SECRET`/the
signing key, the seed script only ever provisions the *first* local user;
creating additional users, or updating/deleting any of them (including the
one the seed script created), goes through the admin API
(`POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE /admin/users*`) described above.

The emergency key-rotation trigger (CONTRACT-003, "kill switch") is
implemented at `POST /admin/emergency-rotate-keys`. It authenticates via a
`Authorization: Bearer <EMERGENCY_ROTATION_TOKEN>` header only — a valid
`bt_session` cookie never substitutes for this credential, and the token is
compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (never `===`) to avoid a timing side
channel. On success it generates a fresh RS256 key pair in-process,
atomically (one PGlite transaction) revokes the previously current signing
key (`status = 'revoked'`, `revoked_at` set, no `retired` intermediate
state), inserts the new key as `current`, and writes a
`result = 'success'` row to `emergency_rotation_audit`, then responds `200`
with `{"status":"rotated","previousKid","newKid","rotatedAt"}` and
`Cache-Control: no-store`. A missing/malformed/incorrect `Authorization`
header returns a generic `401 {"error":"Unauthorized"}`; a failure during key
generation or rotation returns a generic
`500 {"error":"Unable to complete emergency rotation"}`; any other method or
path falls through to the existing generic `404`. Every trigger attempt
(success or failure) writes one row to `emergency_rotation_audit`
(`id`, `triggered_at`, `result`, `triggered_by`, `source_ip`, `previous_kid`,
`new_kid`, `failure_reason`); if that write itself cannot be performed, the
service emits a server-side log line backstop naming only a timestamp and
failure category, never the credential value or any secret material. The
optional JSON request body `{"triggeredBy"?: string}` is an unverified,
operator-self-asserted label stored verbatim when present and `null`
otherwise — it is never part of the authorization decision and a malformed
value never causes the request to fail. Concurrent trigger requests are not
rejected or deduplicated; each independently rotates, and PGlite's
transactional guarantee (exactly one `current` row) serializes them into
consecutive rotations, which is the intended outcome, not an error.

`node scripts/verify-offline.js` (alias: `npm run verify-offline`, which builds
first) is TASK-010's standalone, re-runnable offline-verification proof
against the real compiled service and a real, already-seeded
`PGLITE_DATA_DIR`. It mints a session token directly via `mintSessionToken`
against the current signing key (no interactive Entra login is needed or
used), fetches `/.well-known/jwks.json` once, and verifies the token
completely offline using `jose`'s `createLocalJWKSet` (a global-`fetch`
instrumentation confirms zero network calls happen during the `jwtVerify`
call itself). It then triggers `POST /admin/emergency-rotate-keys`, re-fetches
JWKS, and confirms the same token now fails offline verification because its
`kid` is absent from the fresh JWKS response. Because CONTRACT-002 enforces a
strict single-process lock on `PGLITE_DATA_DIR`, this script reads the
current signing key directly from the database first (releasing the lock
immediately afterward) and only then launches the real compiled service
(`dist/index.js`) itself as a child process against the same `.env`, so the
whole proof remains a single self-contained command rather than requiring the
operator to separately start the service first. If a separate instance of
the service is already running against the same `PGLITE_DATA_DIR`, this
script fails fast with a clear "already locked" error rather than hanging or
corrupting state; stop the other instance first. If the sandbox/host does not
permit live socket binding, the script automatically falls back to invoking
the exported `createRequestHandler` function directly (no real HTTP socket,
no child process) and says so plainly in its output, matching TASK-008/012's
validation precedent. The script prints one clear PASS/FAIL line per
acceptance criterion and exits non-zero if any fail.

On startup, the service creates `PGLITE_DATA_DIR` with mode `0700` when it is
absent, verifies an existing directory is mode `0700` and owned by the running
user, acquires a single-process lock, opens PGlite, and applies the idempotent
schema migration before listening. Existing directories with different mode or
ownership are rejected with a corrective `chmod` or `chown` message; the service
does not modify their permissions or ownership automatically. A lock left after
an unclean process termination must be removed manually after confirming no
other service process is using the directory.

## Coding conventions

- Use TypeScript with strict type checking and ES module-compatible imports.
- Use camel case for variables and functions, Pascal case for interfaces, and
  uppercase snake case for environment variable names.
- Keep bootstrap configuration validation separate from HTTP route setup.

## Testing philosophy

Document required test levels, coverage expectations, fixtures, and manual checks.

## Security and privacy

Document secrets handling, data classification, dependency, and reporting rules.
