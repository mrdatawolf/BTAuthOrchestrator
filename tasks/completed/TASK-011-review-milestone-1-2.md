# TASK-011: Independent review of milestone 1-2 slice

Owner role: Reviewer
Assigned agent: quality-assurance
Proposed by: Jarvis
Proposed date: 2026-08-11
Approved by: Patrick Moon
Approved date: 2026-08-11
Related contracts: CONTRACT-001, CONTRACT-002
Related ADRs: none
Dependencies: TASK-007, TASK-008, TASK-009, TASK-010

## Desired outcome

An independent review confirming the full milestone-1-2 slice (Entra
registration through offline verification proof) meets both contracts and
carries no regressions or security gaps, before Patrick accepts the work.

## Context

Covers everything built across TASK-004 through TASK-010.

## Scope

### Included

- Contract compliance against CONTRACT-001 and CONTRACT-002.
- PKCE/state/nonce correctness.
- Cookie/secret handling.
- Confirmation that no security decision derives from `NODE_ENV`.
- Private key isolation (never exposed via any endpoint/log).
- Envelope-encryption correctness (ciphertext at rest, KEK never in the
  database).
- Data-directory permissions.
- Single-process constraint.
- Rotation behavior (both the emergency trigger and the offline-verification
  proof of a rotated-out key failing).
- Entra-unreachable failure path.

### Excluded

- Implementing fixes (reviewer reports findings only, per
  `docs/roles/reviewer.md`).

## Plan

1. Review implementation against CONTRACT-001 and CONTRACT-002 clause by
   clause.
2. Verify security-sensitive behaviors listed in Scope > Included directly
   (inspect stored data, attempt to trigger `NODE_ENV`-derived behavior,
   etc.), not just read the code.
3. Record findings per `docs/templates/review-report.md`, separating
   blocking findings from recommendations.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Review recorded per the repo's review-report template.
- [ ] Every item in Scope > Included addressed explicitly (pass/fail/
      finding).
- [ ] Blocking findings clearly distinguished from non-blocking
      recommendations.

## Validation requirements

N/A — this task is itself the validation step for TASK-004–010.

## Risks and assumptions

None.

## Blocker

None.

## Implementation handoff

Not applicable — TASK-011's Owner role is Reviewer; this task has no
implementer/implementation of its own. The work of this task *is* the
independent review recorded below.

## Review

Outcome: **Human decision required**. Full review document:
`docs/reviews/TASK-011-milestone-1-2-review.md`.

Every item in Scope > Included was directly, hands-on verified against the
real compiled service (live sockets where this sandbox permitted them,
including a from-scratch mock-Entra harness, direct PGlite row inspection,
tamper/wrong-key decryption tests, concurrent-process and concurrent-rotation
tests, and a live re-run of TASK-010's own `verify-offline` proof) rather
than only read from implementer handoffs, and all passed: PKCE/state/nonce
correctness including tampering and replay, cookie/secret handling and
`NODE_ENV` independence, private-key isolation, envelope-encryption
correctness, data-directory permissions, the single-process constraint,
CONTRACT-003's emergency-rotation trigger (including atomicity, concurrency,
and audit trail), and the Entra-unreachable 502 path. One finding needs
Patrick's decision rather than being a plain defect: CONTRACT-002 specifies a
`rotateSigningKey`/`revokeKey` interface that TASK-009 did not implement,
substituting a different function to solve an atomicity problem CONTRACT-003
itself had explicitly flagged as an open question for Patrick to resolve
before implementation — functionally correct and transparently documented,
but not escalated first. A second, already-tracked, non-blocking item
(TASK-003d's TLS provisioning still pending) is restated for visibility.
See the full report for every finding, its severity, and the evidence behind
it.

## Human acceptance

Pending.
